# Developed vs. Developing Countries
Exploring Air Quality Disparities

## Getting Started: 
1. Report and presentation
2. data/: Contains cleaned datasets used for the analysis
3. notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks
4. visualizations/: Tableau visualizations and dashboard
5. scripts/: Python and SQL scripts for data analysis

### Tools:
Excel, Jupyter, Python, SQL, Tableau

### Data Sources:
* World Health Organisation PM2.5 dataset (2010 - 2019) 
* [Country classification](https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/policy/wesp/wesp_current/2014wesp_country_classification.pdf)
* [Human Development Index (HDI)](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/human-development-index#/indicies/HDI)
* [United Nations Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States](https://www.un.org/ohrlls/)

The analysis will be based on the provided dataset, which includes the following fields:
* Region
* Country
* Year
* IsLatestYear
* Residence Area Type
* FineParticulateMatterCount
* FineParticulateMatterLow
* FineParticulateMatterHigh
* Value

## Problem Definition
Air quality is a critical component of environmental health, affecting millions of people worldwide. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is a common air pollutant that poses significant health risks, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Understanding the distribution and trends of PM2.5 levels is essential for developing effective environmental policies and public health interventions.

## Hypothesis
Over time, PM2.5 levels in developed countries show a decreasing trend, while developing countries may experience either stable or increasing trends due to rapid urbanization and industrialization without adequate pollution control measures.

## Vision
Contribute to a comprehensive understanding of global air quality disparities and provide actionable insights that can help bridge the gap in environmental health between developed and underdeveloped countries. By highlighting trends and identifying key factors influencing air quality, the study aims to support the development of targeted policies and interventions that improve air quality and public health outcomes worldwide.

## Objective
* Identify significant differences in air quality between urban and rural areas within these countries.

## Key Insights
### Dashboard
## Next Steps
* Access to more granular and up-to-date air quality data from various regions to enhance the accuracy and comprehensiveness of our analysis.
* Conduct an analysis of existing air quality monitoring data to identify regions with insufficient monitoring infrastructure and prioritize them for monitoring system enhancements.
* Analyze the correlation between air quality data and existing infrastructure quality (e.g., public transportation availability, green spaces) to identify areas where investments in sustainable infrastructure could significantly improve air quality.
* Examine the relationship between air quality levels and health outcomes, particularly respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, to develop targeted healthcare programs.
